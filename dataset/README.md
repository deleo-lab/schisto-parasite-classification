# Parasite Image Dataset for Schistosomiasis Research

## Introduction
Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) infecting over 250 million people worldwide. The current approach to mitigate this disease is to deliver the drugs to treat needed communities. However, parasites are primarily transmitted through environment reservoirs where freshwater snails serve as intermediate hosts. People use the contaminated water source for their daily tasks and get re-infected after the drug treatment. Therefore, drug administration alone is not effective for Schistosomiasis control. Recent studies [1, 2] show that snail population control is essential to spot disease transmission risks. To discerning between human parasitic worms and other non-human parasitic species in snails is a necessary step to precise quantification of human risk. As part of Stanford's [Program for Disease Ecology, Health and the Environment](https://ecohealthsolutions.stanford.edu/), our team has collected 5,140 images of parasitic cercariae, from 11 morphospecies liberated from the Biomphalaria and Bulinus spp. snails encountered and dissected, in Senegal Africa during 2015-2018. This dataset is made public for the research community.
